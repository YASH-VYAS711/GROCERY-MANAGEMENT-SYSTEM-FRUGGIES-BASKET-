# GROCERY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-FRUGGIES-BASKET-
The "Grocery Management System" project aims to develop an efficient e-commerce platform, named "Fruggies Basket," to facilitate
the online purchase and management of grocery items. This system allows users to browse through a variety of vegetables and fruits,
add items to their shopping cart, and place orders for either delivery or pickup. It features a user-friendly interface that supports both
customer and administrator functionalities. Key features include user registration and login, a searchable product catalog, secure
payment processing, order tracking, and an admin panel for managing products, orders, and user accounts. This project is designed to
enhance convenience for customers, optimize inventory management for administrators, and ultimately improve operational efficiency in
the competitive grocery retail industry
